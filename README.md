I do nothing, Here is the project: http://blacktie.co/2013/10/victoria-simple-vcard/. Thanks so much. It let me have a beautiful individual web site. 

Above all, I'm Colin, I'm a newbie!

When it comes to coding no one is the best and if you really enjoy it youâ€™ll always keep progressing.

Yeah, I'm not real programmer, but I try my best.

I like Linux, like JS, like coding, etc.
